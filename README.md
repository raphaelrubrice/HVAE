# Hyperspherical Variational Auto-Encoders

Work on the [Hyperspherical Variational Auto-Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00891) paper by Tim R. Davidson, Luca Falorsi, Nicola De Cao et al.
The objective of this project is to prepare a presentation to Pr. Stéphanie ALLASSONNIERE that showcases a deep understanding of the paper:
- What is new, or at least claimed to be ?
- What is interesting in the approach ?
- What is not interesting ?

To do so, we decided to reimplement their approach, reproduce their experiments and even extend it on a different application: scRNA-seq data. Through these initatives we hope to display a very strong grasp of the authors' work.

## Reimplementation
We decided to code their approach using PyTorch and Scipy.

## Reproduction of experiments

## Extension on single-cell data
